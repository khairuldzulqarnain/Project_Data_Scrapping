RPA Project: Property Information Scraper


###Overview###

This RPA (Robotic Process Automation) project is designed to automate the extraction of property information from iProperty.com based on user-provided city names. The automation process involves utilizing a browser tool to navigate the iProperty website, searching for specific location details, and extracting data related to service apartments.

Project Workflow
User Input:

The RPA starts by prompting the user to input the desired city name.
Web Scraping:

Utilizing a browser tool, the RPA navigates to iProperty.com and extracts information related to service apartments in the specified city.
Filtering:

The RPA narrows down the search to focus exclusively on service apartment listings.
Data Extraction:

Using the 'Extract Data Table' feature, the RPA collects information including Price, Price per sqft, Build-up, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Carpark, URL, and Address.
Data Storage:

Extracted data is organized and written to Excel files for easy access and analysis.
